# What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is fantastic for creating large web applications with ever changing data, without the need to reload a page (think social media feeds or incoming email messages). It definitely helps that it's really fast and super scalable, too. It's also important to note it only works on user interfaces in application.

# What does it mean to think in react?

To think in React is to think in applications as you build them. It's all about creating components that can be reusable, maintainable, and easy to test. Since it's a declarative library for building user interfaces, learning React can be both fun and challenging as it allows us to create what we tell it to create, rather than describing control flow.

# Describe state.

State is one of the single most important concepts in programming. It's essentially where our data is stored, used to update a component when a user performs some kind of action, like button clicking, key pressing, and text typing. Simply put, state allows us to create components that are much more dynamic and interactive.

# Describe props.

Props is how we send data to components when using react. They are pretty similar to parameter in vanilla javascript.

# What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side effects are can be anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. One of the most common side effects are network requests, which is how we make our API calls to third party servers.
